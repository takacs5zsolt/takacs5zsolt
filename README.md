# Hi, I'm Zsolt

## About my background

I'm programming since I was 13 yo. At the time, I made several different game modes for GTA San Andreas Multiplayer, so me and my class mates could have fun.

Later on I studied at the University of Obuda, Budapest where I unfortunatelly dropped out at the end of the 4th semester.
After this I joined Ruander, where I study Software Development. Right now I'm at the end of this journey and will take my finals at Jan of '22.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software architecture, design patterns and algorithms. Basically the essential stuff to solve any problem.
- ðŸŽ¶ My hobbies are drawing, watching movies, reading a good SCI-FI & learning.
